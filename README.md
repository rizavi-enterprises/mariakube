Have No Fear! No Vendor Lock Over Here!

MariaKube launches business applications as Kubernetes (K3s) pods, and stores persistent data in a MariaDB instance. 

As a Kubernetes pod itself, MariaKube is a self-contained Flask app, and is used as a launch point for all of your customized business apps (marketing, invoicing, operations). 

This way all business use cases, from a "Schedule a Tour" app, to replacing an existing Enterprise CRM, can be launched and managed from the same place, by business admins.
